When this runs, it produces nice rectangular labelled buttons with a flat, slightly 3D appearance. I attempted to get the same effect as follows:

    FlowLayout flowLayoutManager = new FlowLayout(FlowLayout.RIGHT);
    JPanel lowerPanel = new JPanel(flowLayoutManager);
    lowerPanel.setBorder(
            BorderFactory.createEtchedBorder(
            EtchedBorder.RAISED));
    lowerPanel.setBackground(Color.ORANGE);
    lowerPanel.setPreferredSize(new Dimension(700, 100));
    lowerPanel.setMaximumSize(lowerPanel.getPreferredSize());
    lowerPanel.setMinimumSize(lowerPanel.getPreferredSize());

    /*
     * cardReaderButtonPanel holds three card reader control buttons
     */
    JPanel cardReaderButtonPanel = new JPanel(new GridLayout(1, 3, 10, 0));
    cardReaderButtonPanel.setBorder(BorderFactory.createEmptyBorder(8, 0, 0, 0));
    cardReaderButtonPanel.setOpaque(false); // transparent background

    String[] labels = {"Load", "Stop", "Start"};
    for (String label : labels) {
        JButton button = new JButton(label);
        cardReaderButtonPanel.add(button);
    }
    lowerPanel.add(cardReaderButtonPanel);
... but my buttons look like Mac OS X Aqua lozenges! Unlike in the Calculator example, I'm adding the panel of buttons to an enclosing panel that itself is enclosed by the center of a BorderLayout - but I don't see how that could influence the way a button is drawn.
